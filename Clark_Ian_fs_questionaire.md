*What is your ideal next role?*

My next idea role is getting into a junior level front end developer or fullstack developer position.

What interest me about fullstack development is that there is so much you can do on the front and back end. It keeps work interesting and it makes me always wanting to learn.

I do not require sponsorship.

*What is the last thing you learned/taught yourself that was not a direct requirement of your job/role at the time and why?*

The last thing I taught myself and still learning currently is sass. I wanted to learn sass because it allows you to take your css to the next level and to keep it organized.
